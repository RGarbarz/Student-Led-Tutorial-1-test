# Tutorial for Bowtie2, SAMtools, and Visualization with IGV 
# Date: Feb 13th
1. Bowtie2 and SAMtools should already be downloaded
2. IGV needs to be downloaded onto your computer
3. **IGV**:
   - **Desktop**: [Download IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)
   - **Web-based**: [Use IGV Web App](https://igv.org/app/)
#Fork Student-Led-Tutorial-1 repository, this is where you can send your data after it is analyzed
#In order to get all files in your workspace use:
  git clone [insert repository link]
# Download the refrence genome (FASTA)
wget https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.alt.fa.gz
Following the link (https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/) will show other refrence genomes that can be used. We used the first one.
# Also downloand the two sequencing reads. 
These can be searched for through https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186573
It shows publically avalable wgs-sew datasets from GEO.
If you were to chose your own:
   Scroll down from the link page and hit 'SRA run selector'
   The table shown includes GSM samples, giving information such as sample accessions (begin with gsm) and metadata like age, sex, and health condition.
   One sample for this tutorial should be a healthy donor (NC)
  Find the SRR acession according to your chosen sample and click on it
   Navigate to the FASTA/FASTQ download tab
   ???Use the SRA toolkit to download paired-end-FASTQ files
   module load sra-toolkit
   fastq-dump --split-files SRR11412215
Replace SRR11412215 with your SRR acession of your sample and do for both samples
Ours:
Healthy donor: SRR16574653
Stage 3B donor: SRR16574627

You can chose your own, but we provided examples here for your conveinence.
START BACK UP WITH THE "data preperation" section
I also think we need to add the SRA download.slurm code? Like 99% sure thats how it gets downloaded into gitbash, we need to add this to the tutorial

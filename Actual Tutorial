Tutorial for Bowtie2, SAMtools, and Visualization with IGV 
Date: Feb 13th

Required software: 
1. Bowtie2 and SAMtools should already be downloaded
Open by:
module load bowtie2 AND>>>???
2. IGV needs to be downloaded onto your computer. heres how to do it:
   - Desktop: [Download IGV](https://software.broadinstitute.org/software/igv/download)
   - Web-based: [Use IGV Web App](https://igv.org/app/)

First steps:
Fork Student-Led-Tutorial-1 repository, this is where you can send your data after it is analyzed
#In order to get all files in your workspace use:
  git clone repositorylinkexample.com

Log into your bridges account in gitbash and open your personal folder in ocean
/ocean/projects/agr250001p/your-psc-username

Download the refrence genome (FASTA)
wget https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/Homo_sapiens.GRCh38.dna.alt.fa.gz
then gunzip the file
Following this link (https://ftp.ensembl.org/pub/release-110/fasta/homo_sapiens/dna/) will show other refrence genomes that can be used. We used the first one.
Also download two sequencing reads. 
These can be searched for through https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/query/acc.cgi?acc=GSE186573
It shows publically avalable wgs-sew datasets from GEO.
If you were to chose your own:
   Scroll down from the link page and hit 'SRA run selector'
   The table shown includes GSM samples, giving information such as sample accessions (begin with gsm) and metadata like age, sex, and health condition.
   One sample for this tutorial should be a healthy donor (NC)
  Find the SRR acession according to your chosen sample and click on it
   Navigate to the FASTA/FASTQ download tab
   ???Use the SRA toolkit to download paired-end-FASTQ files
   module load sra-toolkit
   fastq-dump --split-files SRR11412215
Replace SRR11412215 with your SRR acession of your sample and do for both samples
Ours:
Healthy donor: SRR16574653
Stage 3B donor: SRR16574627

You can chose your own, but we provided examples here for your conveinence.

SLURM:
Edit the slurm script to include your email, username, and SRR acession number in the appropriate spots like we have done in class before. The code to edit:
vi sra-download.slurm
You will also need to change the output name for each dataset
Navigate to the directory where the script is located (if not already there):
cd /path/to/your/script

Submit the job to the SLURM scheduler:
sbatch sra-download.slurm

Once the job completes, check the output log file:
cat /ocean/projects/agr250001p/your-username/download_sra.log

THE FOLLOWING IS COPIED FROM THE ASSIGNMENT REQUIREMENTS AND WILL NEED TO BE EDITIED. WE LIKELY NEED TO ADD MIRE DETAIL!

Index the reference genome using Bowtie2:
bowtie2-build reference.fasta reference_index 
replace refrence.fasta with the file name for the refrence data

I HAVE NOT TESTED ANYTHING BEYOND THIS POINT

Part 2: Mapping Reads

Align the sequencing reads to the reference genome using Bowtie2:
bowtie2 -x reference_index -1 reads_1.fastq -2 reads_2.fastq -S aligned.sam
Process the SAM file using SAMtools

Convert to BAM:

samtools view -Sb aligned.sam > aligned.bam
Sort and index the BAM file:

samtools sort aligned.bam -o sorted.bam
samtools index sorted.bam
Compute basic statistics:

samtools flagstat sorted.bam
Part 4: Visualization:

Load the reference genome and sorted BAM file in IGV (Desktop or Web-based).
Highlight:
Coverage across interesting regions (e.g., BRCA1).
Mismatches or SNPs in the alignments

NOTES:
ADD SLURM CODE TO THIS REPOSITORY
DO WE NEED TO ADD PARTS ON SUBMITTING A JOB TO THE REPOSITORY? i think thats needed in order to open the data in IGV???
